###### Features:
- Move around the map to find Pokemon
- Battle the pokemon you find in the map
- Have a party of pokemon
- Can easily switch between pokemon in battle
- Moves that have different stats and types
- Pokemon with different stats
- Ultimate goal is to defeat Red

###### Bugs: 
- Can switch to the Pokemon that's already out in the fight
- If your pokemon dies, there's no delay between the death message and the pokemon selection screen
- Defeating red currently returns you to the map screen; trying to fight him again will cause an error
- Must heal at a Pokecenter once defeated, otherwise it crashes at the next fight
